How to upload a Jupyter notebook to your Github as a new repo
1.First you will need to make sure you have Git installed. Go to your command line and type git --version. If it gives you any type of error, then go to git-scm.com to download and install Git. 
2.Once Git is installed, create a local folder containing all of the content for your Jupyter Notebook (make a folder put your notebook in it). 
3.Open your terminal window (simply Terminal on Mac or Git Bash on Windows) and navigate to the folder location using cd file-path. 
4.Once you are in the folder, type git init . - your notebook is now under version control. 
5.Now you will type git add . to add all of the files to the staging area. 
6.And git commit -m "Initializing notebook" will take a snapshot of this version of the notebook. 
7.When you make changes, just do steps 5 and 6 again. At this point your notebook is versioned but now you need to get it on GitHub. 
8.Log in to GitHub.com and click the + sign on the top right corner to create a repository. 
9.Do not choose the option initialize with a readme. 
10.Once you click the Create Repository button, you will see instructions for how to upload your file onto GitHub.
